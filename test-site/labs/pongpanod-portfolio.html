                <h3>Learning Programming: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p><em>July 9, 2025</em></p>
                <p>Programming has been one of the most rewarding yet challenging aspects of my digital media engineering studies. When I first started with Python in my freshman year, I struggled with concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. The syntax seemed overwhelming, and I often felt lost when trying to solve complex problems.</p>
                <p>What helped me improve was consistent practice and breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces. I started solving simple programming challenges on platforms like professional programmer with complex algorithms. I also found that explaining my code to classmates helped me understand concepts better.</p>
                <p>Now, as I work with technologies like HTML,CSS,JavaScript, I can see how the fundamental programming concepts I learned with Python apply across different languages.</p>
